# Titanic-dataset-applying-EDA
🚢 Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A deep dive into the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and insights that influenced survival rates. This project focuses on cleaning the data, visualizing key features, and identifying relationships using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
🧠 Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Handle missing values and categorical variables
Analyze survival patterns based on features like gender, age, class, etc.
Visualize key insights using plots
Prepare dataset for predictive modeling (optional)
📊 Key Findings
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate.
Class: Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive.
Age: Children had a slightly better chance of survival.
Family size: Small families had a better survival rate than those alone or in large groups.
